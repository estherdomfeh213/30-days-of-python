# Quick Notes 


### Command-line arguments
## When a Python file is run directly, the special variable "__name__" is set to "__main__". Therefore, it's common to have the boilerplate if __name__ ==... shown above to call a main() function when the module is run directly, but not when the module is imported by some other module. In a standard Python program, the list sys.argv contains the command-line arguments in the standard way with sys.argv[0] being the program itself, sys.argv[1] the first argument, and so on. If you know about argv, or the number of arguments, you can simply request this value from Python with len(sys.argv)
